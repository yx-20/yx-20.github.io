    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This is a group project, other two members are <a href="mailto:zirouq@g.clemson.edu" title="Zirou Qiu" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-opacity">Zirou Qiu</a> and <a href="mailto:diejieg@g.clemson.edu" title="Diejie Gao" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-opacity">Diejie Gao</a>.

      <p>In this project, we focus on the cultural resource allocation of New York City. We use the dataset provided by FourSquare which
        consists of the venue check-in history of users. After exploring many related works on pattern extraction, spatial data clustering,
        and optimization, we choose algorithms suggested by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05694" title="Zhou et al" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-opacity">Zhou et al</a>.

    <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <h3>â˜… Demand-supply ratio computation</h3>
      <p>I construct the demand-supply model using Gaussian function. </p>
      <p>The following two figures show how to determine the demand level and supply level.</p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="assets/lcp1.PNG" alt="lcp1 img" style="width:50%;">
        <div class="w3-small w3-center">Fig1. The demand level of user u on venue x</div>
      </div>
      <p>The demand level of one venue is defined by the probability of users going to that venue.
        First we know the clusters of each user from POPTICS, and each cluster has a center u and radius ru .
        Then we determine that level based on the assumption suggested by Zhou et al such that for a certain user, his/her
        demand for a particular cultural pattern (his/her pattern) is highest at the cluster center and decrease as we move away from the center.
        In general, the demand level of the venue x for user u is computed using the formula suggested by Zhou et al. :
      </p>
      <p>\[d_u(x) = {\frac{1}{\sqrt {2\pi r_u^2}}e^{{-\left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } \over 2r_u^2}}. \]</p>
      <p>In Fig. 1, the user u has two clusters enclosed by blue circle and red circle.
        Each cluster contains several venues where user had been to.
        To calculate the demand level of venue x, we first determine the cluster the encloses the venue x.
        In this example, the venue x is in the blue cluster, then we use the blue clusters center and radius to compute the demand level.
        For each user, we filter out the venues that does not belong to the pattern of this user before passing them to the POPTICS.
        Therefore, ru is the active range of user u for his/her pattern.
        The demand for venue x of its own pattern is the sum of demands of all users who have visited x.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="assets/lcp2.PNG" alt="lcp2 img" style="width:50%;">
        <div class="w3-small w3-center">Fig2. An example of computing the supply level of x</div>
      </div>
      <p>The supply level of a venue x is defined by the service capability of that venue.
        The assumption is that the service of a venue x can reach a user u if u has visited x before.
        Therefore, we determine the set of users who has visited x at least once and compute the average distance, denoted by &#963;,
        between their active centers (output of POPTICS) and the location of x.
      </p>
      <p>\[d_u(x) = {\frac{1}{\sqrt {2\pi \sigma^2}}e^{{-\left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } \over 2\sigma^2}}. \]</p>
      <p>The Fig. 2 illustrate an example of computing the distance between centers of uses and x.
        In this example, there are four users had check-ins at venue x. I calculate the distances between their centers with x.
